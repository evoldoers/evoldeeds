Plan for REST API.

Ultra-simple at first: client can query list of families, retrieve specific family, and post or retrieve a history.
Database tracks current best history for each family.

No authentication is necessary for this microservice; the client can attribute a history to a player when posting,
but the server does not need to verify that the client is logged in as that player.

DynamoDB tables:
evoldeeds-families. Primary key 'id'
evoldeeds-histories. Partition key 'family_id', sort key 'date'

API
api.evoldeeds.com/families/ GET
api.evoldeeds.com/families/{id} GET
api.evoldeeds.com/histories/{family_id} POST
api.evoldeeds.com/histories/{family_id}/{date} GET
