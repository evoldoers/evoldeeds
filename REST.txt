Plan for REST API.

Ultra-simple at first: client can query list of families, retrieve specific family, and post or retrieve a history.
Database tracks current best history for each family.

1. Create DynamoDB tables
2. Create Lambda CRUD API https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-dynamo-db.html
3. Create a Makefile for updating Lambda function
4. Create Cognito user pool, add authentication

DynamoDB tables:
evoldeeds-families. Primary key 'id'
evoldeeds-histories. Partition key 'id', sort key 'date'

API
api.evoldeeds.com/families/ GET
api.evoldeeds.com/families/{id} GET
api.evoldeeds.com/histories/{family}/ POST
api.evoldeeds.com/histories/{family}/{id} GET
