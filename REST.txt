Plan for REST API.

Ultra-simple at first: client can query list of families, retrieve specific family, and post or retrieve a history.
Database tracks current best history for each family.

1. Before posting: validate history, check family exists, retrieve family sequences, check history explains family, calculate score
2. If score is better than current best for family, update family table
3. Create Cognito user pool, add authentication

DynamoDB tables:
evoldeeds-families. Primary key 'id'
evoldeeds-histories. Partition key 'family_id', sort key 'date'

API
api.evoldeeds.com/families/ GET
api.evoldeeds.com/families/{id} GET
api.evoldeeds.com/histories/{family_id} POST
api.evoldeeds.com/histories/{family_id}/{date} GET
